# AI Emotion Detector

This repo is an experimental project that detects human faces and visually displays emotions around the face with canvas in the video element.

The project was developed with the [face-api](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) library.

You can check the demo of the project [here](https://ai-emotion-detector.netlify.app/).
